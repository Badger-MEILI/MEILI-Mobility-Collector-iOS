"contentText"="This mobile application seamlessly collects trips (movement trace, transitions and stays/destinations) of its user and is part of the MEILI System, which is composed of this mobile application and a web application that allows the periodic convenient travel-diary-annotation of the collected trips. The collected travel diaries give valuable insight into the travel needs of individuals and the population, which are essential in transportation planning. The use of the MEILI Mobility Collector is voluntary. The mobile- and web applications give user-controls for suspending collection or deleting a collected trip and the collected data is only analyzed in an anonymous form for research purposes.";
