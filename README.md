# MEILI iOS Mobility Collector 

Implementation of the iOS Mobility Collector that is compatibile with the MEILI API (v2api and master)

The code can compile, but the following will be needed to extend it:
  - Document
  - Clean up code 
  - Test on the newest version of iPhones (last tested version was iOS 8) 
  - Declare a config file to store all the URL String values (now they are in registerViewController.m, ViewController.m, and serviceViewController.m [Might have missed something])
